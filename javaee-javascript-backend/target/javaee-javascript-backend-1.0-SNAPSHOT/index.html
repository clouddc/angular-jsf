        <h2>Java EE Mobile Server</h2>
        <p>The mobile server consists of a chat WebSocket API
        and a to do list REST API implemented using the Java 
        API for WebSocket, JSON-P, JAX-RS 2 and Java EE 7.</p>
        <p>Note that while this page is not secured, both the WebSocket and
        REST endpoints are secured using HTTP BASIC authentication and SSL. You
        can set the usernames and SHA-256 encrypted passwords in the SQL load
        scripts of the application source.</p>
        <p>The WebSocket chat endpoint is at: 
            <a href="wss://localhost:8181/javaee-mobile-server/chat">
                wss://localhost:8181/javaee-mobile-server/chat</a>. The 
            endpoint communicates via JSON. Once connected, a client
            can send a chat message using this format:
        <pre>
        {"user": "the name of the user", 
         "message": "the chat message"}
        </pre>
        Each chat message sent to the server will be echoed back to all 
        currently connected clients including the client that sent the 
        message. The server will also include the timestamp on the server
        when the message was received. The chat messages echoed back 
        from the server will follow this format:
        <pre>
        {"user": "the name of the user that sent the message", 
         "message": "the echoed chat message", 
         "timestamp": "the server timestamp - MM/dd/yyyy h:mm:ss a z"}        
        </pre>
        </p>
        <p>The REST endpoint is available at <a href="https://localhost:8181/javaee-mobile-server/resources/todo">
                http://localhost:8080/javaee-mobile-server/resources/todo</a>. The
           REST endpoint also communicates with the client using JSON.
           To do items are stored under various usernames. To retrieve
           the current to do items for a given user, the client must issue
           a GET request to this URL: <a href="https://localhost:8181/javaee-mobile-server/resources/todo/{username}">
                https://localhost:8181/javaee-mobile-server/resources/todo/{username}</a>.
           The server will respond with the list of current to do items for the
           user following this format:
        <pre>
        [{"id": "to do item ID", 
         "title": "item 1 title",
         "description": "item 1 description", 
         "completed": "true|false"},
         {"id": "to do item ID", 
         "title": "item 1 title",
         "description": "item 2 description", 
         "completed": "true|false"}
         ...]        
        </pre>
        To add an item for a user, the client must issue a POST request to
        this URL: <a href="https://localhost:8181/javaee-mobile-server/resources/todo/{username}">
                https://localhost:8181/javaee-mobile-server/resources/todo/{username}</a>.
        The POST body must follow this format:
        <pre>
        {"title": "item title",
         "description": "item description"}
        </pre>
        An ID will be automatically assigned and the item will be assumed to be
        incomplete. The POST response will return the ID assigned to the item as plain text (not JSON). 
        To modify a to do item, the client must issue a PUT
        request to this URL: <a href="https://localhost:8181/javaee-mobile-server/resources/todo/{username}/{id}">
                https://localhost:8181/javaee-mobile-server/resources/todo/{username}/{id}</a>.
        The PUT request body must follow this format:
        <pre>
        {"id": "to do item ID", 
         "title": "item title",
         "description": "item description", 
         "completed": "true|false"}
        </pre>
        To delete a to do item, the client must issue a DELETE request to
        this URL: <a href="https://localhost:8181/javaee-mobile-server/resources/todo/{username}/{id}">
                https://localhost:8181/javaee-mobile-server/resources/todo/{username}/{id}</a>.
