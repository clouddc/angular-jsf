Java EE 7 server-side application with an AngularJS front-end consisting of a chat application (
powered by WebSocket) and a to-do list application (powered by REST). The server-side is implemented using 
the Java API for WebSocket, JSON-P, JAX-RS 2, CDI, Bean Validation, EJB 3 and JPA.

The application is secured. Before running the application, you must setup the right GlassFish security 
realm using the asadmin commands in the same directory as this file. You can also set the username/passwords 
via the database scripts in the source code. The passwords are stored as SHA-256
hashes. The current users are reza, nicole and zehra. The passwords are set to secret1. When using the 
application, the browser will warn you about the self-signed SSL certificate that GlassFish uses by default. 
Simply ignore the warning, it's harmless.

The project is in standard Maven format. You should be able to open it using any IDE that supports Maven and 
run it using any Java EE 7 container. However, we used NetBeans and GlassFish 4. Note that the project uses 
the default Derby database that comes with GlassFish. Here are the instructions to get up and running
using NetBeans and GlassFish:

* Install JDK 7
* Install GlassFish 4+
* Install the NetBeans 7.4+ Java EE version
* Setup GlassFish in NetBeans (make sure Derby is started with GlassFish)
* Open and build the project
* Execute the asadmin commands in the 'create-javascript-realm.bat' file. The second command is more 
  important and the first one might fail, so don't execute the batch file directly
* Run the project on GlassFish 4
* Open up a browser and go to http://localhost:8080/javaee-javascript-main
