        <h2>JavaScript/HTML5 Rich Clients with Java EE 7</h2>
        <p>This application demonstrates how Java EE 7 can be an extremely
            effective backend for JavaScript/HTML5 rich clients. The application
            shows the use of APIs like WebSocket, JSON-P, JAX-RS, CDI,
            Bean Validation, EJB 3 and JPA. AngularJS is used as the JavaScript
            front-end framework. However, the choice of AngularJS is somewhat
            arbitrary and not central to the application. The concepts and backend
            could also be utilized by Backbone.js, Ember.js, KnockoutJS, JQuery or
            perhaps even plain JavaScript.</p>
        <p>
            There are two main parts of the application:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A <a href="todo.jsp">to do interface</a> that utilizes REST.</li>
            <li>A <a href="chat.jsp">chat interface</a> that utilizes WebSocket.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The backend REST and WebSocket APIs are documented 
            <a href="backend.html">here</a>.</p>
