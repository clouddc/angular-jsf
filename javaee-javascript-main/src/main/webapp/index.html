        <h2>JavaScript/HTML5 Rich Clients with Java EE 7</h2>
        <p>This application demonstrates how Java EE 7 can be an extremely
            effective backend for JavaScript/HTML5 rich clients. The application
            shows the use of APIs like WebSocket, JSON-P, JAX-RS, CDI,
            Bean Validation, EJB 3 and JPA. AngularJS is used as the JavaScript
            front-end framework. However, the choice of AngularJS is somewhat
            arbitrary and not central to the application. The concepts and backend
            could also be utilized by Backbone.js, Ember.js, KnockoutJS, JQuery or
            perhaps even plain JavaScript.</p>
        <p>
            There are two main parts of the application:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A <a href="todo.jsp">to do interface</a> that utilizes REST.</li>
            <li>A thin-server chat interface that utilizes WebSocket, with several variants:
                
                <p><a href="chat.jsp">pure thin-server</a></p>
                <p><a href="faces/chat.xhtml">add I18N</a></p>
                <p><a href="faces/chat-with-template.xhtml">add I18N and templating</a></p>
                <p><a href="faces/chat-with-skin.xhtml">add I18N, templating and skinning</a></p>

            
            
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Note that while this page is not secured, both the interfaces are
            secured using HTTP BASIC authentication and SSL. You
            can set the usernames and SHA-256 encrypted passwords in the SQL load
            scripts of the application source.</p>
        <p>The backend REST and WebSocket APIs are documented
            <a href="backend.html">here</a>.</p>
