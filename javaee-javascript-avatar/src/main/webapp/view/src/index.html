            <h2>JavaScript/HTML5 Rich Clients with Java EE 7</h2>
            <p>This application demonstrates how Java EE 7 can be an extremely
                effective backend for JavaScript/HTML5 rich clients. The application
                shows the use of APIs like WebSocket, JSON-P, JAX-RS, CDI,
                Bean Validation, EJB 3 and JPA. Oracle's Avatar is used as the JavaScript
                front-end framework. However, the choice of Avatar is somewhat
                arbitrary and not central to the application. The concepts and backend
                could also be utilized by AngukarJS, Backbone.js, Ember.js, KnockoutJS, JQuery or
                perhaps even plain JavaScript.</p>
            <p>
                There are two main parts of the application:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>A <a href="#todo">to do interface</a> that utilizes REST.</li>
                <li>A <a href="#chat">chat interface</a> that utilizes WebSocket.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Note that while this page is not secured, both the interfaces are
                secured using HTTP BASIC authentication and SSL. You
                can set the usernames and SHA-256 encrypted passwords in the SQL load
                scripts of the application source.</p>
            <p>The backend REST and WebSocket APIs are documented
                <a href="#backend">here</a>.</p>
